# Pandas-Challenge
UC Berkley Visual Analytics Bootcamp Module 4 assignment
I had difficulties merging more than 2 dataframes, so I decided to include extra cells, then broke the task into merging 2 dataframes at a time then, merging the resulting dataframes. Although it worked and I got the dataframes that I ultimately wanted, but I got help from Saad Khan, who suggested that that is a tedious way and I don't need to be merging. Also, what I did to get the per_school_summary involved passsing the values to make it, and Mr. Saad explained that what i was doing was hard-coding and my program won't be dynamic. Lastly, when I ran the code for binning under score by school spending, I was getting a TypeError '<' is not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'. The less than sign was in the labels preceeding $585; Mr. Saad explained that I should just apply the pd.cut to per_school_capital because the formatting done to get per_school_summary has changed the datatype. He shared the code to make the DataFrame for per_school_summary with me and asked that I comment out the two additional cells that I had inserted for merging a couple of df's at a time. It took me forever, but, I have better confidence in myself.
